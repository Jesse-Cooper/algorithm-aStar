# A* Algorithm

This project demonstrates an application of the A* algorithm in an 8 directional movement system.

## Application

A C program that displays randomly generated dungeon configurations and find the shortest path between two point using A* is provided.

Uses the seed `7907`.

### Invoking Instructions

The program can be compiled using the `Makefile` (compiled with `make`) and run with `./program`.

Press `Q` to quit.
Press `ANY KEY` (other than `Q`) for a new dungeon configuration.
The terminal size must be at least `72x24` for the program to run.

### Dungeon Generation

Dungeon configurations are generated by randomly placing points and drawing lines of varying sizes between them.

### Pathfinding (A* Algorithm)

For each dungeon configuration the shortest path between its source and target is found using the A* algorithm in an 8 directional movement system.

An approximation (using integers) of octile distance is used as the heuristic which will never overestimate the actual path cost making it admissible.
